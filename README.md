 üí° What MythicMind Can Do

- Generate Deep Character Profiles
  Users can select a genre (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, noir, dystopia) and receive fully fleshed-out characters with names, personality traits, backstories, motivations, and unique quirks.

 Evolve Characters Over Time 
  Each character can be ‚Äúevolved‚Äù with new traits, goals, or story arcs‚Äîideal for long-form storytelling or game development where characters grow and change.

 Prompt Engineering Assistant  
  Behind the scenes, MythicMind uses structured prompt templates to ensure consistent and high-quality AI outputs. Users can even tweak the prompt logic to experiment with different narrative tones.

 Save & Organize Characters  
  Users can save their favorite characters locally or to the cloud (via Supabase), organize them by genre or project, and revisit them anytime.

Shareable Profiles  
  Each character profile can be exported or shared via link‚Äîperfect for collaboration with co-writers, game designers, or editors.

 Genre-Adaptive UI  
  TailwindCSS enables dynamic theming based on selected genre, creating an immersive experience that visually matches the character‚Äôs world.

Scalable Architecture  
  The app is designed to scale with user demand, supporting high traffic and large datasets through modular components and efficient API handling.

 Future Expansion Possibilities 
  - World-building tools (settings, factions, lore)  
  - Visual character cards using AI-generated art  
  - PDF/Markdown export for offline use  
  - Multilingual character generation  
  - Role-based generation (e.g., villain, mentor, sidekick)
